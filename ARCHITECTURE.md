# DeepBasis Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design of the DeepBasis Node.js backend starter kit.

## Overview

DeepBasis follows a modular architecture, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability. The application is divided into three main layers:

- **Core:** Contains fundamental services and utilities used throughout the application, such as logging, event emitting, and health checks.
- **Features:** Implements specific application features, each encapsulated within its own module.  Examples include authentication, user management, and any other business-specific functionalities.
- **Infrastructure:** Provides access to external resources and services, like databases, caching, and external APIs.

### Core

The Core layer provides essential services that are independent of specific business logic.  These services are typically singletons and are available throughout the application.

- **Logger:** Provides structured logging using Winston.  Offers customizable levels, formats, and context-based logging.
- **Event Emitter:**  Facilitates asynchronous communication between modules using Node.js's EventEmitter.
- **Health Service:** Implements health check endpoints for monitoring application status.
- **(Optional) Other Core Services:**  You can add other core services like background job processing, metrics collection, etc.

### Features

The Features layer contains the implementation of specific application features. Each feature is organized as a separate module containing:

- **Controller:** Handles incoming HTTP requests and orchestrates the interaction with services.
- **Service:** Encapsulates business logic and interacts with repositories and other services.
- **Repository (optional, often in Infrastructure):** Abstracts database access logic.
- **Types/Interfaces:** Defines data structures and contracts for the feature.

This modular approach allows for easy development, testing, and maintenance of individual features.

### Infrastructure

The Infrastructure layer handles interactions with external resources.  This includes:

- **Database Service:** Provides an abstraction over the database connection and operations using TypeORM.
- **Cache Service:**  Provides access to a caching mechanism (placeholder implementation provided – you should integrate your preferred solution, e.g. Redis).
- **External API Clients:**  Implement clients for interacting with external APIs.
- **(Optional) Message Queue Service:**  Handles asynchronous messaging.


## Dependency Injection

DeepBasis uses Awilix for dependency injection.  This allows for:

- **Loose Coupling:** Modules are not directly dependent on concrete implementations of other modules, promoting flexibility and testability.
- **Testability:**  Dependencies can be easily mocked during testing.
- **Maintainability:**  Changes in one module are less likely to impact other modules.


## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Certain functionalities, like logging and error handling, are implemented as cross-cutting concerns using middleware and aspects.

- **Request Logging:** Middleware logs incoming requests and their processing time.
- **Error Handling:**  A centralized error handler middleware catches and processes errors consistently throughout the application.

## Future Considerations

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** For more complex applications, consider implementing CQRS to separate read and write operations.
- **Event Sourcing:**  Combine with event sourcing for improved auditability and scalability.
- **Microservices:** As the application grows, consider breaking it down into smaller, independent microservices.


This architecture document serves as a guide for understanding and evolving the DeepBasis application.  As new features and services are added, ensure that they align with the principles of modularity, separation of concerns, and dependency injection.
