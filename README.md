# DeepBasis: A Node.js backend starter kit (Template)

DeepBasis provides a robust foundation for building scalable and maintainable Node.js applications.  This repository serves as a template, offering a pre-configured structure, dependency injection, best practices for logging, error handling, configuration, and more.  Clone this repository to jumpstart your next backend project.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture:**  Organized into modules (core, features, infrastructure) for clear separation of concerns and improved code maintainability.
- **Dependency Injection:** Uses Awilix for dependency injection, promoting loose coupling and testability.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Integrates Winston for structured logging with customizable levels and formats. Includes request logging middleware for detailed tracking.
- **Centralized Configuration:**  Manages configuration using Zod for validation and environment-specific overrides.
- **Robust Error Handling:**  Implements a custom error handler middleware and defines common error types for consistent error management.
- **Database Integration (Ready for Setup):** Designed to support PostgreSQL using TypeORM. Includes an abstract database service and repository pattern for easy database interaction. **You will need to configure your database connection.**
- **Authentication Module (Example):**  Provides a basic authentication module with user registration, login, and token refresh functionality as an example implementation.  Customize and extend as needed.
- **Health Checks:**  Includes a health check endpoint for monitoring application status and dependencies.
- **Caching (Placeholder):**  Includes a basic caching service interface and a placeholder implementation. Integrate your preferred caching solution (e.g., Redis).
- **Event Emitter:**  A core event emitter service for asynchronous communication between modules.
- **Helper Utilities:**  Provides common helper functions for tasks like password hashing, JWT management, and safe JSON parsing.
- **Easy Testing:**  The modular design and dependency injection facilitate unit and integration testing.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepbasis.git
   cd deepbasis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure environment variables based on `src/config/config.schema.ts` and the example environment files in `src/config/environments`.  You'll need to configure your database connection, JWT secret, and any other service-specific configurations.
   - Review and customize the `src/config/environments/*.ts` files for development, production, and test environments.

4. **Database Setup:**

    - **Choose your database:** While this template is designed for PostgreSQL, you can adapt it to other databases by modifying the `DatabaseService` and relevant configurations.
    - **Install database driver:**  If using PostgreSQL, install the `pg` driver: `npm install pg`
    - **Configure connection:** Update the database configuration in your `.env` file and environment-specific configuration files.
    - **Run migrations (or synchronize schema):**  Use TypeORM CLI commands to generate and run migrations, or use the `synchronize: true` option (for development only) in your database configuration to automatically synchronize the schema.

      ```bash
      # Generate migrations:
      npm run typeorm migration:generate -- -n <MigrationName>

      # Run migrations:
      npm run typeorm migration:run

      # Alternatively, for development (NOT recommended for production): set synchronize: true in your database configuration.
      ```


5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Customization

- **Caching:** Replace the placeholder `CacheService` implementation with your preferred caching solution.
- **Authentication:** Extend or modify the provided authentication module to meet your specific requirements.
- **Add features:** Create new modules in the `src/modules/features` directory to implement your application's features.
- **Integrate other services:** Add new modules in the `src/modules/infrastructure` directory for integrating with external services (e.g., email, payment gateways).



## Scripts

- `npm run start:dev`: Starts the application in development mode.
- `npm run start:prod`: Starts the application in production mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run test`: Runs unit tests (add your tests).
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase.
- `npm run typeorm migration:generate -n <MigrationName>` Generate migration files
- `npm run typeorm migration:run` Run migrations
